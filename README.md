# Abstract
The qualification work contains: 57 pages, 24 figures, 4 tables, 16 sources.
Due to the significant growth of sensor data both in volume (number of records) and dimensionality (number of features),
traditional statistical methods of state space analysis or supervised learning tools are no longer effective.
Therefore, the problem of developing new methods arises.
The purpose of the work is to develop a system for detecting anomalies in multidimensional data using deep learning.
This system includes data preprocessing, model building, theoretical and practical evaluation of models, comparison of models on different datasets.
In the course of the work, experiments were conducted with models belonging to different approaches to solving this problem.
This paper examines the RNN LSTM model based on time series forecasting and the RANCoders model based on reconstruction,
as well as their modifications SynLSTM, RANSynCoders (which use the information that the series are asynchronous).
This work proved the effectiveness of the proposed models for use in server systems. Which may indicate that deep learning
models are capable of solving such problems very well.
